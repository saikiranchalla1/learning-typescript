# How to submit the labs?
Before you begin working on the labs, create a repository on Github to save your work. If you're creating a private repository, please add me (saikiranchalla1) as a contributor.

In the enclosed book in this directory, each chapter corresponds to a lab. For each lab, create a new folder in your repository and add all the files relevant to the lab.

After you are done working with the labs, send the link to your repo to the instructor on Zoom chat.

__Note that not all chapters will be covered as labs. Ask the instructor for the labs that you are required to work on.__
