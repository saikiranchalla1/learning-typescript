to install all the dependencies.

## Installing TypeScript
In order to install TypeScript we need Node Package Manager (NPM) which is part of NodeJS. Hence, first install NodeJS:
1. Navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Download the latest LTS and install it.

Once NodeJS is installed, open command line and execute the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g typescript
```

This installs TypeScript on your machine globally and it can be invoked irrespective of the directory.
